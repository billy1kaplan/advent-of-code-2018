Wow this problem felt absolutely horrible.

I think that, while there was a lot of complexity, my approach could have been more methodical.
* The structure and individual actors became blurred.
** This could be improved by fully planning out how messages are passed around before hand (simulate using the mock actors, write out the interaction!)
** Make smaller incremental changes (keep things running from the beginning and throughout, make method initially mock their output for integration testing)
